        <h3>About my family and pets.</h3>
        
        <p> <em>I grew up and stayed in Liberty Center 
            back around twelve years ago</em>. I 
            lived with my mom, dad, and my two 
            sisters. To this day. <span id="LivingStatus"> I still live with
            both of my parents, just in different 
            homes.</span> I live in Liberty Center still, 
            but I also live in <strong>Wauseon</strong>. I have dogs 
            in both houses. Two pitbulls in one house, 
            and a husky and a mixed poodle in the other. I 
            don't mind the divorce. I just mind the
            driving I have to do every day. 
        </p>
        
        <h3>About my school.</h3>
        <!--This is me explaining about my school and
        my band.-->
        
        <div id="SchoolInfo">

        <p>
        I went to Liberty Center schools for eleven
        years. It feels werid being away from the
        School, but I am still in the band for my
        old school. I use to play the cymbals for two
        years, but now I am on the bass drum. I
        decided that I needed a challange, so my
        band director brought me up to bass drum. So
        far I am doing really well. I do sometimes miss
        my friends from my homeschool, but I know this
        is a good decision.

        <h3>My thoughts on Four County</h3>
        
        <p>So far Four County is going great. This 
            lab is going very well in my opinion. 
            The only problem I am ever having is
            the <strong>lunch situation</strong>. I don't really sit
            with anyone at lunch, but its fine in my 
            opinion. All my acidemic classes are going good as well.
            My only hardest one I'm worried about is algebra, but I
            am starting to think I am above average in my class. 
            Four County is going great tho.
